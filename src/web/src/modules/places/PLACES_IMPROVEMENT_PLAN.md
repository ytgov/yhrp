# Places Module Improvement Plan

## Project Goals

- Improve mobile responsiveness
- Enhance user experience (UX)
- Create a more intuitive information architecture
- Ensure consistent navigation across all Places views

## Current Issues

1. Mobile Layout

   - Print button visibility on mobile
   - Gallery and map layout on small screens
   - Navigation bar consistency across views

2. UX Concerns

   - Nested expansion panels make information hard to find
   - Inconsistent navigation patterns
   - Information hierarchy needs improvement
   - Language switcher positioning

3. Performance
   - Large component file sizes
   - Potential for better code organization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Mobile Layout Restructuring ✅

- [x] Create responsive layout system
- [x] Implement mobile-first design principles
- [x] Optimize gallery and map for mobile
- [x] Hide print button on mobile views
- [x] Ensure consistent navbar behavior

### Phase 2: UX Improvements (In Progress)

- [x] Extract PlaceHeader component
- [x] Extract PlaceGallery component
- [x] Extract PlaceDesignation component
- [x] Implement vertical tab navigation
- [x] Improve information hierarchy
- [x] Improve map centering behavior
- [x] Implement consistent navigation patterns
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling

### Places List View Improvements

- [x] Make grid layout responsive (adjust columns for different screen sizes)
- [x] Standardize breadcrumb navigation
- [x] Improve filter/search UI for mobile
- [x] Add proper loading states and transitions
- [x] Add proper error states and messages
- [x] Implement consistent card design
- [x] Add proper pagination for mobile
- [ ] Improve filter section accessibility

### Phase 3: Performance & Polish

- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images
- [ ] Add proper error boundaries
- [x] Optimize component rendering (removed duplicate location filter)
- [ ] Verify coordinate data types in map component (ensure lat/long are numbers)
- [x] Refactor CSS to use Vuetify utilities

   - [x] Gallery and map properly sized
   - [x] Consistent navbar behavior

2. User Experience

   - [x] Clear information hierarchy
   - [x] Intuitive navigation
   - [x] Improved content organization
   - [x] Better language switcher placement
   - [ ] Consistent navigation patterns
   - [ ] Proper loading states
   - [ ] Clear error messages

3. Performance
   - [ ] Fast initial load time
   - [ ] Smooth transitions
   - [ ] Optimized image loading
   - [ ] Proper error handling

## Current Status

- Phase 1 completed ✅
- Phase 2 in progress:
  - [x] Component extraction complete
  - [x] Vertical tab navigation implemented
  - [x] Information hierarchy improved
  - [x] Map component improved with better centering
  - [x] Places list view improvements completed
  - [ ] Navigation patterns pending
- Phase 3 partially started:
  - [x] CSS optimization with Vuetify
  - [x] Component rendering optimization
  - [ ] Remaining performance tasks pending

## Next Steps

1. Implement consistent navigation patterns
2. Add proper error boundaries
3. Begin remaining performance optimizations
4. Add TypeScript types
5. Implement testing

## Notes

- All changes should be tested across different devices and screen sizes
- Maintain accessibility standards throughout implementation
- Document any new components or significant changes
- Consider adding analytics to track user interaction with new features
