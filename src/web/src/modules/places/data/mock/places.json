The company operated up to nineteen stores in Yukon communities from the turn of the century until the 1960s. This relatively large log home and spacious landscaped lots, by Whitehorse standards, reflects the success of the family-owned business and the upper class of Whitehorse of the period.\n\nThe design of the Taylor House is eclectic, showing the influence of the American Arts and Crafts Movement as well as the (American) Colonial Revival. It represents a type of housing design commonly self-built during its time period that could be found in national publications and catalogues. The Taylor House was built of mainly local construction materials combined with the most modern amenities that were available in Whitehorse.\n\nThe setting and location of the Taylor House is important as it portrays the residential ambiance that was once an integral part of Main Street. It is a landmark in the historic downtown area of Whitehorse.",

    "culturalHistory": "The Taylor & Drury Company, co-founded by Isaac Taylor and WS Drury in 1897, grew quickly into a Yukon-wide mercantile chain. By 1928 the company operated twelve stores in the Yukon and the Whitehorse dealership for General Motors.\n\nWilliam (Bill) Taylor was the son of Isaac and Sarah Drury Taylor. He worked for the Taylor & Drury Company during his teen years, and advanced to full time after high school. Bill was educated at the Lambert Street School. He then attended the University School in Victoria where he was on the B.C. Championship rugby team. After graduating, he spent a year at the Seattle Fur Exchange learning the fur business and attending night classes in accounting.\n\nAline Taylor was largely responsible for the design of the house. She was the daughter of Marie Ange Arbour Beaudin from Grand Riviere, Quebec, who arrived in the Yukon in 1918 speaking no English. Bill and Aline were married in 1935 at the Old Log Church. They rented a house for two years until they purchased the 412 Main St. property.\n\nIn May 1937, Bill and Aline Taylor harvested their house logs approximately 10 miles from Whitehorse and then stacked them for drying at 412 Main Street. By December of the same year, the house was ready for occupancy.\n\nThe Taylor House was sold in 1969 to the Chamber of Mines when the mining industry was the major economic activity in the Yukon. The Chamber of Mines began having difficulties in the early 1990s when the price of gold declined and the cost of fuel increased. Unable to afford the necessary renovations and maintenance on the building, the Chamber sold the property to the Yukon Government in 1997.\n\nThe government completed extensive interior renovations to adapt the house for office space. The Taylor House was used for many years as office space by the Yukon Heritage Resources Board. The Office of the Commissioner moved to the Taylor House in 2015.",

    "description": "The White Pass & Yukon Route (WP&YR) Depot in Whitehorse was designated for its historic and architectural values. The railway depot is representative of the fundamental role that the WP&YR had in Whitehorse and Yukon's economic history and the development of a territory wide transportation system from the early twentieth century. Its location illustrates the historic link between the WP&YR rail and water transportation divisions.\n\nThe WP&YR Railroad was constructed in 1898-1900 to service the Klondike Gold Rush, carrying freight and passengers from the ocean port of Skagway, Alaska to the Yukon interior. WP&YR bought and surveyed the Whitehorse townsite as a typical railway town with the railway depot as the focal point at the two main intersecting streets. The transportation industry was essential to the economic growth and stability of the isolated territory with long distances between communities.\n\nThe original WP&YR Depot was constructed in 1900 but burned in the 1905 fire that destroyed downtown Whitehorse. The replacement structure constructed in 1905 was less adorned and smaller than its predecessor. It underwent several additions and alterations to respond to the changing requirements of its occupants. The roof line changed from a traditional style with a two story hipped gable central block with one story hipped gable wings to a 2 story low pitched gable extending the length of the building. The simple plan, stick sign, simulated log cabin siding and wood-shingled roof contribute to the building's northern rustic appearance. The deep canopy skirting the building at the second floor level and large neon sign on the roof add to the visual impact of the property. The open, wood paneled lobby area and large ticket office window demonstrate an original function of the building.\n\nThe freighting industry changed after 1942 with the war time construction of the Alaska Highway and the end of large scale river transport with the completion of roads into the interior in the mid 1950s. The freight yards in Whitehorse gradually moved from the downtown waterfront up to the Alaska Highway. The WP&YR Depot remained as the main office and head of operations until 1982 when the rail division shut down. Purchased by the Yukon Government in 1987, the building has undergone extensive rehabilitation and is now leased as office space.",

    "culturalHistory": "The White Pass and Yukon Route Railway was built between 1898 and 1900 from Skagway, Alaska, to Whitehorse, Yukon; a distance of 110 miles (177km). It is a narrow (3ft) gauge railway that had 21 stops, in addition to stations these included section houses, water tanks, trestles, tunnels, and bridges. There were four large depots on the route at Skagway, Bennett, Carcross and Whitehorse but many stops included a station or section house of varying sizes as well as support infrastructure. The railway operated continuously until 1982 as a passenger-freight combination then shut down during a recession. The Carcross station was constructed in 1900 and burned in a 1909 fire. The extant building was constructed in 1910 and used as a train depot until 1982. The section from Carcross-Skagway was re-opened as a tourist railway in 2006.\n\nAfter the great fire of 1905 razed the original station, a replacement was quickly erected. Perhaps due to the necessity of replacing the building quickly, or because the White Pass realized the Yukon's economy was not what it expected to be, the replacement building was 1100 square feet smaller and architecturally less refined than the 1900 original. Although a small Mail Room was added, the Police Quarters, Private Office, and the separate Customs Office were removed from the main floor. The upstairs apartment was reduced to four rooms from six.\n\nIn 1911, further changes were made through a rearrangement of the upstairs apartment into offices. In the mid- to late 1930s, another 19 feet was added to the upper floor, squaring off the hipped roof, and creating more office space. Downstairs was now the exclusive domain of the railway operations and upstairs housed the offices of the administrative staff. This division held until the train service ceased in 1982.\n\nWorld War II saw the American military take over operation of the railway and as well as another extension to the building. A new addition at the north end of the building added 14 feet to the main floor and 27 feet to the second floor. The extra space was required for the extra personnel operating the railway that went from one train a day to almost one per hour during the peak of the war effort to complete the Alaska Highway and Canol pipeline.\n\nFollowing the war, White Pass got into the bussing business with their new Highway Division. They took over the American Army bus service to Dawson Creek, bought their own buses, and built some highway lodges. The railway depot was also the bus terminal for several years. White Pass ran the bus service for about 20 years before selling out to Canadian Coachways.\n\nIn the 1950s, the ailing White Pass came under new management and was modernized. They were one of the first in the world to explore container shipping. The expansion was made possible by the increase in Yukon mining production and White Pass thrived again. This led to yet another expansion of the depot. In 1953, they added an addition to the south end of the building that balanced the north end addition of 1942. There were interior office rearrangements as well as painting and new finishes. This was done several times in subsequent years. The split log siding was added to the exterior in 1953 to give the depot a northern flair.",
