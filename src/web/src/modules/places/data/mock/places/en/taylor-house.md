## Description

The Taylor House and lots is a municipally designated site designated for its architecture and association with the Taylor family.

It was constructed in 1937 as a residence for Bill and Aline Taylor. The Taylor family contributed to the early growth and economic development of the Yukon through the mercantile chain, the Taylor and Drury Company. The company operated up to nineteen stores in Yukon communities from the turn of the century until the 1960s. This relatively large log home and spacious landscaped lots, by Whitehorse standards, reflects the success of the family-owned business and the upper class of Whitehorse of the period.

The design of the Taylor House is eclectic, showing the influence of the American Arts and Crafts Movement as well as the (American) Colonial Revival. It represents a type of housing design commonly self-built during its time period that could be found in national publications and catalogues. The Taylor House was built of mainly local construction materials combined with the most modern amenities that were available in Whitehorse.

The setting and location of the Taylor House is important as it portrays the residential ambiance that was once an integral part of Main Street. It is a landmark in the historic downtown area of Whitehorse.

## Cultural History

The Taylor & Drury Company, co-founded by Isaac Taylor and WS Drury in 1897, grew quickly into a Yukon-wide mercantile chain. By 1928 the company operated twelve stores in the Yukon and the Whitehorse dealership for General Motors.

William (Bill) Taylor was the son of Isaac and Sarah Drury Taylor. He worked for the Taylor & Drury Company during his teen years, and advanced to full time after high school. Bill was educated at the Lambert Street School. He then attended the University School in Victoria where he was on the B.C. Championship rugby team. After graduating, he spent a year at the Seattle Fur Exchange learning the fur business and attending night classes in accounting.

Aline Taylor was largely responsible for the design of the house. She was the daughter of Marie Ange Arbour Beaudin from Grand Riviere, Quebec, who arrived in the Yukon in 1918 speaking no English. Bill and Aline were married in 1935 at the Old Log Church. They rented a house for two years until they purchased the 412 Main St. property.

In May 1937, Bill and Aline Taylor harvested their house logs approximately 10 miles from Whitehorse and then stacked them for drying at 412 Main Street. By December of the same year, the house was ready for occupancy.

The Taylor House was sold in 1969 to the Chamber of Mines when the mining industry was the major economic activity in the Yukon. The Chamber of Mines began having difficulties in the early 1990s when the price of gold declined and the cost of fuel increased. Unable to afford the necessary renovations and maintenance on the building, the Chamber sold the property to the Yukon Government in 1997.

The government completed extensive interior renovations to adapt the house for office space. The Taylor House was used for many years as office space by the Yukon Heritage Resources Board. The Office of the Commissioner moved to the Taylor House in 2015.
